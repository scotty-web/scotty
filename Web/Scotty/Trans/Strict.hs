-- | This module is essentially identical to 'Web.Scotty.Trans', except that 
-- some functions take/return strict Text instead of the lazy ones.
--
-- It should be noted that most of the code snippets below depend on the
-- OverloadedStrings language pragma.
--
-- The functions in this module allow an arbitrary monad to be embedded
-- in Scotty's monad transformer stack in order that Scotty be combined
-- with other DSLs.
--
-- Scotty is set up by default for development mode. For production servers,
-- you will likely want to modify 'settings' and the 'defaultHandler'. See
-- the comments on each of these functions for more information.

      -- route that matches. If no route matches, a 404 response is given.
